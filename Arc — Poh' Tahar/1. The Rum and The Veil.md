We reached Traneti Town under the escort of Ysriel of Solidor. There, we set ink to parchment, requesting entry to the Grand Library of Poh’ Tahar. Ysriel departed with our words, leaving us to wait as she carried them back through the mist for letters and amulets to guard our minds.

The waiting hours led us into the Bazaar Festival. Magic gleamed from every stall, not as rare treasure, but as common craft for daily life. I found a bottle of Poh’ Taharan rum, sharp in scent, while the others wandered the glow of lanterns and trinkets. I overheard whispers cautioning against the Veil—a shadow that bends the mind, endured only by slow familiarity.

Althaea’s kindness drew her to aid an elder named Ruth Marigold, who gave her a cupcake to share. That night, the Outcasters sat together—rum, sweetness, and the strange comfort of company beneath festival lights. A rare quiet, before the road turned dark.

When dawn came, Ysriel returned bearing our letters and the amulets of veil resistance. With purpose renewed, we stepped into Barney’s Magical Shop, where Bernard showed us stones of curious design. We chose three—refrigeration, purification, and light—humble crafts, yet worthy companions on the road ahead.

Before leaving, we returned to Ruth once more, aiding her with small labors. She spoke of her grandson, Tom Marigold, apprenticed to Magnolia, and placed a marigold hairpin in Althaea’s care. With her blessing, we turned toward the looming mists.

The Veil of Whispering Shadow swallowed us whole. The air grew heavy, the trees bent close, and silence pressed against thought. Then, ahead on the path, stood two shadowed figures—waiting.
