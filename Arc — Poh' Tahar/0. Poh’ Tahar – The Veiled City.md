Poh’ Tahar is a city unlike any other, shrouded in an ancient magical mist known as the Veil of Whispering Shadow. The Veil was woven long ago to guard the city, shielding it from threats both mundane and arcane. For the unprepared, however, the Veil is perilous: stepping into its embrace without protection can unravel the mind, driving a caster especially into madness. Newcomers must wear a special amulet to endure their first steps through it until they grow accustomed to its influence.

Within its boundaries, Poh’ Tahar thrives as a beacon of magical advancement. Unlike other cities where enchanted items remain the privilege of nobles and scholars, here, magic saturates daily life. Ordinary citizens light their homes, cook meals, and conduct trade with the aid of crafted magical equipment.

The city is ruled by three noble houses, each holding dominion over distinct aspects of life:

- House of Landis – Masters of commerce, espionage, and wilderness affairs. They weave trade routes, maintain spy networks, and secure the wilds around the city. Their leader is March Landis, Warden of the Wild
    
- House of Magnolia – Guardians of magical knowledge and research. Their scholars maintain the Grand Library and oversee the arcane defenses that keep Poh’ Tahar safe. Their leader, Rose Magnolia, Arch Mage of the Veil, commands respect and fear alike.
    
- House of Solidor – The martial strength of the city. They command the standing armies and enforce order. Their leader, Vayne Solidor, High Marshall of the Iron Guard, ensures the city’s walls are as strong as its wards.
    

Together, the three Houses make Poh’ Tahar a jewel hidden in mist, a city of both wonder and danger.
