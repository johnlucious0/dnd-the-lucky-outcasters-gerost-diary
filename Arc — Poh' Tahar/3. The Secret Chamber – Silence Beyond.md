The Veil parted, and within its shifting mist we were met by two shadowed guardians of Landis. Their task was clear—to guide us, the Lucky Outcasters, safely to the Grand Library. Beneath their watch, we passed through its vast halls until at last we stood before Toross Luxidor, the aged keeper of its office, his elven features lined with time and burden.

Toross spoke of troubles festering within the Library. For three months, the hidden section behind his office had claimed all who entered. None returned. The doors were sealed, and silence lingered beyond, save for a single soul who staggered out—bloodless, his life utterly drained. By Ysriel’s word, Toross deemed us capable of facing what others could not. The charge was given: uncover the truth, and do so within a week.

The task carried weight, yet Toross armed us well. Ten thousand gold was granted, alongside the freedom to request items needed for our descent. With this, we sought Grovaic Anviljaw, a dwarven smith of renown, whose hands shaped magic as readily as steel. Our bargain was hard, but the preparations began to take form.

On the second day, we returned to Toross, pressing further for clarity. A spell of Speak with Dead was cast upon one of the fallen, and from brittle lips came fragments of truth. Yet when we sought greater aid, Toross denied our plea for more funds. Still, the path was set—the sealed chamber awaited, and with it, the silence that had swallowed so many before.
