Our path led us into the Chamber’s depths, where purpose pressed heavy upon us. We gathered coins enough to dream of a forging plate and a rune of stonehide for Aurea, and I endured ten hours of grueling training to sharpen both will and body. Only then did we step into the office of Toross, who granted us entry to the Grand Library and the logs we sought.

Within those records lay the tragedy of Stranvath Meadowmaw, grandfather to Elara. To save her from the Crimson Rot, he delved into forbidden lore, uncovering the Scarlet Thesis—a tome steeped in blood manipulation. His hope to heal twisted into obsession, and soon madness took him. Our charge was set: uncover the truth of his descent, and end him if redemption proved beyond reach.

The Chamber opened before us, its path spiraling to a sealed gate. Blood marked the floor, and rubble barred the way. Aurea cleared the stones with patient strength, while Mhurren forced the door wide. Within, two fiends of crimson flesh lunged to meet us. Their forms fell swiftly, and Althaea drew their essence into what she named the Vial of Crimson Ichor.

Beyond lay the restricted shelves, where at last we unearthed the Scarlet Thesis itself. Dark script whispered of powers best left buried, proof of the doom Stranvath had embraced. Yet as we turned to retreat, the walls shook—the Sanguine Overlord had awoken.

The battle was a storm of blood and fury. At last the fiend unraveled beneath our combined might, its strength torn asunder. From its ruin, Aurea claimed the three rings it bore. With that final act, the Overlord’s body dissolved into dust, and the Chamber lay silent once more.
